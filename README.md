CORRECT principle

-Conformance -> test whats happen when the input data doen not have the specified format

-Ordering -> test if for example elements from a list are in specified order

-Range -> test if input and outpus respects the specified intervals (Seems like Right, Boundary
and Error form Right-BICEP principle)

-References -> external references are needed for some tests, this tests are done with tests doubles
(stub, fake, dummy,mock)

-Existance -> similar with Error from Right-BICEP (do a test if there is no condition o Internet)

-Cardinality -> Similar with Existance test and Range tests (inductia matematica)

-Time -> Similar with Performance form Right-BICEP principle
